## Spotify OAuth Not Working

If the Spotify login button doesn't work or you get a 500 error, follow these steps:

### 1. Check Environment Variables

**Development**: Visit this URL in your browser to check if environment variables are set correctly:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/debug/env
```

**Production**: Use the authenticated debug endpoint with your secret key:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_DEBUG_SECRET_KEY" https://www.playpals.online/api/debug/env
```
Note: Set a `DEBUG_SECRET_KEY` environment variable in production and use it in the Authorization header to access this endpoint securely.

You should see something like:
```json
{
  "NODE_ENV": "production",
  "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID": "SET",
  "SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET": "SET", 
  "NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL": "https://www.playpals.online",
  "DATABASE_URL": "SET",
  "FIELD_ENCRYPTION_KEY": "SET"
}
```

### 2. If Environment Variables Are Missing

If any show "NOT SET", you need to add them in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add the missing variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.playpals.online
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your_spotify_client_id>
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_spotify_client_secret>
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_database_url
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice**: The previous version of this guide contained exposed Spotify credentials. If you used those credentials:
1. **Immediately revoke the old credentials** in your [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. **Generate new credentials** in the Spotify Dashboard
3. **Update your Vercel environment variables** with the new credentials
4. **Redeploy your application** to use the new credentials

### 3. Check Spotify App Configuration

Make sure your Spotify app redirect URI is set to:
```
https://www.playpals.online/api/auth/callback/spotify
```

### 4. Check Vercel Function Logs

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to Functions tab
3. Look for errors in the `/api/auth/spotify` function

### 5. Test the OAuth Flow

1. Click the "Continue with Spotify" button
2. Check the browser's Network tab for any failed requests
3. Look for any error messages in the console

### Common Issues

**500 Error**: Usually means environment variables are missing
**404 Error**: Check if the API routes are deployed correctly
**Redirect Loop**: Check if the Spotify redirect URI is correct

### Quick Fix

If you're still having issues, try:
1. Redeploy the application in Vercel
2. Clear your browser cache
3. Try in an incognito/private window
